```swift
var animal =  "Dog"  // variable declaration
animal = "Cat" // changing variable value

let car = "Mercedes" // constant declaration
car = "Kia" // Xcode will throw an error
```

As you probably know variables can vary which means we can change it's values during the coding process.
Constants (let in Swift) is a value which cannot be changed. If you tried to do it xcode will refuse to build our app.

Why we shoud separate var/let? 
- prevent from making mistakes 
- constant values makes our code run faster
